The **lower** probability is the probability to **move from state 1 to state 2** and the **higher** is to **remain in the state 2**. This is due to the fact that since we moved from the header to the body it's impossible to see again the body because we know that each mail contains exactly one header and one body, each mail follows once the transition from 1 to 2.\n",
